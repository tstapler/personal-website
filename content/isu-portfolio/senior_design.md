# Why?

Every year farmers across America lose hundreds of thousands of dollars selling their head. Keeping track of each individual head’s feed, weight, age, and health is an overwhelming task to do be hand. On top of this, the Chicago Stock Exchange only provides room for profit a few hours each week.

Cattle Krush allows farmers to track every aspect of each individual head’s health. It automatically calculates useful figures such as the cost of feeding head to a certain weight, or how long it will take for a head to reach its target weight. It also offers live notifications to the farmer when their head can be sold for a profit on the Chicago Stock Exchange.

With Cattle Krush, farmers are finally able to effectively track their cattle’s growth, and consistently sell them for a profit on the open market. Cattle Krush is the future of livestock management.

# The Journey

I was the technical lead for this project. The greatest challenge was the ambitious scope. Creating an application which could run on iOS, Android, and Web was difficult. We ran into a large amount of development environment issues when creating the application. Over all, the experience was positive for myself and my team members who gained stronger development skills and most importantly communication and teamwork skills.
