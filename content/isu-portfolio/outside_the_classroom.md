While at Iowa State, I have been heavily involved on campus and the community.

I spent four years in the ISUCF'V'MB (Iowa State Cyclone Football 'Varsity' Marching Band). For three of those years I played snare drum, and for my final year I was selected to be one of the three drum majors. Through the band I have been able to travel to places like Memphis, Tennessee for the Liberty Bowl in 2012, and Normandy France to represent the United States in the 2016 D-Day commemorative ceremonies.

**Leadership Experience**  
- Drum Major (ISUCF'V'MB): Managed 300+ member organization, coordinated logistics for international performances  
- Hackathon Team Lead: 3x Hack ISU winner (2015-2017)  
- Open Source Contributor: Published 15+ projects on GitHub  

**Technical Outreach**  
- Taught web development workshops for ISU CS department  
- Mentored 5+ student projects through Engineering Student Services  
- Presented at Midwest Dev Conference 2016 (IoT Security)

I have participated most the "Hack ISU" hackathons hosted by Cy-Make at Iowa State since their inception. Participation in hackathons has helped me hone my software development skills.
