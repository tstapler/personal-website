Peeps solves a common workplace challenge - remembering colleagues' names and roles. Our Microsoft One Week Hackathon team built this Outlook-integrated solution using Microsoft Graph API to:

1. Pull employee photos and organizational data
2. Generate personalized recognition quizzes
3. Track learning progress with spaced repetition

Rather than static flashcards, Peeps creates dynamic learning paths based on reporting structures and team relationships. Security remained paramount - we implemented Microsoft Identity authentication to protect sensitive organizational data.

**Technologies used**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - Microsoft Graph API
  - Angular 2
  - Redux
