Written in C#, Kinect With Yoga uses the Microsoft Kinect to bring the self-therapeutic value of yoga to your home. Through a simple desktop interface, users can select one of six default yoga positions. After a position is selected, a stick figure overlay appears on the screen to show the correct posture. Using skeletal tracking, the Kinect detects users and live updates them on how closely they match the selected yoga position. After a user has matched the position and held it for 10 seconds, another position can be chosen. 

This prototype can be adapted for motion/gesture based actions and new yoga positions can be easily uploaded via text file.
