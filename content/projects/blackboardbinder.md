Blackboard binder is a tool for managing Blackboard Materials. My team built the application to scratch a personal itch. It has always been painful to manage course materials on blackboard and we wanted to help alleviate the problem. 

To achieve this we built a webscraper which would log in to Blackboard as the given user and then download the course materials from all of their classes.

The project was built using python and the flask web framework. Much of our parsing logic was built using the Selenium browser automation framework.
