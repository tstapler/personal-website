Sky Dev is a multi-user web based IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and text editor which facilitates team programming. Users of Sky Dev, can remotely collaborate with teammates on programming projects. The features include: an integrated development environment that features code completion, chat service, multi user text editing, and the ability to run code using the built in console.

Sky Dev is built using Dart, a general purpose programming language which can be run on a stand-alone VM or compiled to Javascript. We were challenged by using a language which is relatively sparsely used. In addition, we had a difficult time debugging some issues we ran into while calling React.js from Dart.
